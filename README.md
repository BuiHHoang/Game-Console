# Game-Console
This is some Game in console - that I write by C/C++ during the autumn of 2020 - 3 months after I joined the life of coding.
I write this to play with my friends - so it may have some strange sentence :))
All files of these are writing in DevC (32 bits) - so it may have some bug if you run in other IDE (I am going to fix it now).

Here is the games list:
  1 Chess: Chess game with 2 player, you can share you screen & playing with your friends :)
    + Feature:
      - Add points after each match
      - Can request for draw after 50 turn & request for back to the previous turn.
      - Choose your color.
    + Plan for future:
      - Countdown time, chatting, playing with computer, etc.
  2 X-O: Original - simple :), I have one version of X-O (3x3) and X-O (generality - uncomplete)
    + Feature:
      - Play with computer (3x3), add points for each match
    + Plan:
      - Update 'computer' for X-O (generality).
      - Countdown time, more players, ...

In the end, thank you for reading this :), have a good day!
